NEC Linkbird mips(el) Linux USB-serial modules

NEC didn't provide Linux kernel sources for its Linkbird MX series so I managed to compile a vanilla Linux 2.16.19 kernel for its 64 bit mips cpu.

Although they announce it as 64 bit mips, it is running at 32 bit and modules had to be compiled for 32 bit little endian mips (mipsel)

The stock kernel didn't allow USB-serial devices (only cypress M8 was compiled)

Since they didn't release their kernel sources modprobe won't work and insmod has to be used.

To use them do the following:

modprobe usb-serial

insmod theserialmoduleyouwant.ko

To save them inside Linkbird board use mountrw command

Do a "zcat /proc/config.gz" to see original kernel config

I had to compile those modules in order to use GPS devices and I'll put some advice here:

Linkbird comes with gpsd 2.33 and can't probe some gps modules.

Do:

killall gpsd
stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
gpsd /dev/ttyUSB0

/* where 115200 is usually 4800 (look at gps specs) */
